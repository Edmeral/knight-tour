Calculates the [Knight's tour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) path, beginning at a given position.

Running `$ node knight-tour.js 0` would give this output:

```
0,17,32,49,59,53,63,46,61,55,38,23,6,12,2,8,25,40,57,51,41,56,50,60,54,39,22,7,13,3,9,24,18,1,16,33,48,58,52,62,47,30,15,5,11,26,43,28,45,35,20,14,29,44,34,19,4,10,27,42,36,21,31,37
```

which can be translated to an image using this [Khan Academy visualization](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/knight-tour/6458118317932544) I made:

Beginning on the square number 56 for example would give us something like this:
